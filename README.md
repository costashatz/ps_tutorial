Python code for the Policy Search (quick) tutorial

## Contents

### Simple Policy Optimization Example

The file `1-ps_opt.py` contains code for using direct policy search for the continuous mountain car problem and a simple Evolutionary Strategy.

### Priors on Policy Structure Example

The file `2-prior_policy.py` uses the continuous mountain car problem, a simple Evolutionary Strategy and linear policies to showcase the advantages of priors on the policy structures.

### Learning the Dynamics Model Example

The file `3-model_learning.py` uses Gaussian processes and the continuous mountain car problem to showcase how we can collect data and learn a dynamics model.
